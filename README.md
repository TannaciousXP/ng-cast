# NG-Cast

Task to build YouTube Video player app using [Angular JS](https://angularjs.org/).

## AngularJS is Interesting in a few key ways

- AngularJS uses a mix of standard and custom HTML elements and attributes that transforms standard HTML into HTML with superpowers.
- When using AngularJS, developers don't hae to think about when to re-render or how to exract values from the DOM (for example, a developer does not need to query an input element to obtain its current value).
- AngularJS improves code quality and modularity because your modules never directly reference external dependencies. Most precisely, AnglarJS supplies dependencies to your modules in a way that decouples your code from any other code.

## High-Level Goals

- Learn AngularJS and learn how to think about web apps as components in Angular.
- Continue practicing interctions with a REST API (in this case, the [YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/?hl=en))
